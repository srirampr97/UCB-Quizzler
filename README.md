# UCB-Quizzler
UCB-Quizzler is a Java Console Application that allows users to create, attend and view quizzes.
 
### Validations
We want to support other kind of validations for question's answer, some of them are:
   * Text validations
     * Max length
     * Only uppercase text
     
Because there will be the new question type *NUMERIC* we want to add the support for a *MAX* validation  

### Storage
Currently all the information is stored on memory, that means quizzes are lost after finishing the application. 

### Unit testing
Included unit tests to validate quizzler
 
# NOTE
To run the application you must have installed OpenJDK-11
